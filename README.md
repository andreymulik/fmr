# Fields for monadic records

Simple interface for record-like access for any mutable data.

## Reasons

This package is designed as part of a more complex project.

`fmr` generalizes wxHaskell's Attr-Prop syntax for any monad and data source.
Thus, you can easily modify the data represented, for example, by an abstract
foreign type.

## Versioning

fake-records follows of the [Haskell PVP](https://pvp.haskell.org).
