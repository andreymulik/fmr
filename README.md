# Fake records

Simple interface for record-like access for any data.

## Reasons

This package is designed as part of a more serious project.

fake-records generalize wxHaskell's Attr-Prop syntax to all monads and data
sources. Thus, you can easily modify the data represented, for example, by an
abstract foreign type (see alpm binding).

## Examples

Now it's just a small experimental package, nothing complicated. As an example
of its use, you can look at [libalpm](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman)
[binding](https://github.com/andreymulik/alpm).

## Versioning

fake-records follows of the [Haskell PVP](https://pvp.haskell.org).
