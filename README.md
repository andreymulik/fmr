# Fields for monadic records

Simple interface for record-like access for any mutable data.

## Reasons

This package is designed as part of a more complex project.

`fmr` generalizes wxHaskell's `Attr` and `Prop` definitions. Thus, you can
easily modify the data represented, for example, by an abstract foreign type.

## Versioning

`fmr` follows of the [Haskell PVP](https://pvp.haskell.org).
