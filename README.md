# Fake records

Simple interface for record-like access for any data.

## Reasons

This package is designed as part of a more serious project.

fake records generalize wxHaskell's Attr-Prop syntax for any monad and data
source. Thus, you can easily modify the data represented, for example, by an
abstract foreign type.

## Versioning

fake-records follows of the [Haskell PVP](https://pvp.haskell.org).
